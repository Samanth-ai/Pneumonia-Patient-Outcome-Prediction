# Multi-Task Deep Learning for Pneumonia Patient Outcome Prediction

This project uses a multi-task deep learning model to predict ten different clinical outcomes for pneumonia patients from the MIMIC-IV dataset. The goal is to build a tool that can aid clinicians by providing simultaneous predictions for patient mortality, length of stay, and risk of developing critical conditions like sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI).

## üéØ Project Objective

Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection with highly variable patient outcomes. This project aims to predict these outcomes accurately to assist with:

* **Clinical Decision-Making:** Identifying high-risk patients who may require more immediate attention.
* **Resource Allocation:** Optimizing the management of hospital beds and ICU resources.
* **Personalized Care:** Developing tailored treatment strategies for individual patients.

The core of this project is a multi-task neural network built with PyTorch that simultaneously predicts **10 patient outcomes**.

## üíæ Dataset

The project utilizes the **MIMIC-IV** dataset, a large, freely-available database comprising de-identified health-related data from patients who stayed in the intensive care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

A comprehensive cohort of pneumonia patients was extracted using detailed **SQL queries in Google BigQuery**. The extracted data includes:
* Patient demographics
* Admission and ICU details
* Vital signs (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure)
* Lab results (e.g., creatinine, lactate)
* Comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, cancer)

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

The project followed a multi-stage process, from data extraction and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

### 1. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

* **Categorical & Numerical Features:** Handled missing values through mean imputation for numerical columns and label encoding for categorical data like gender.
* **Feature Scaling:** Standardized all numerical features using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn to ensure they have zero mean and unit variance, which helps the model train more effectively.
* **Target Transformation:** Applied a log transformation (`np.log1p`) to the `hospital_los` and `icu_los` targets to normalize their skewed distributions, improving regression performance.

### 2. Multi-Task Model Architecture

A multi-task neural network was built in PyTorch to handle the ten prediction tasks concurrently.

* **Shared Layers:** The model starts with shared layers consisting of `Linear` layers, `ReLU` activation, `BatchNorm1d`, and `Dropout`. These layers learn a common, useful representation of the patient data.
* **Task-Specific Output Layers:** Following the shared layers, the model branches into ten separate linear output layers‚Äîone for each target variable. This allows the model to make specialized predictions for each outcome.
* **Loss Functions:** A combination of loss functions was used to train the model:
    * `BCEWithLogitsLoss`: For the eight binary classification tasks (e.g., mortality, sepsis).
    * `MSELoss`: For the two regression tasks (hospital and ICU length of stay).
    * **Weighted Loss:** To address class imbalance in the mortality and myocardial infarction tasks, a weighted BCE loss was used to give more importance to the minority class.

### 3. Knowledge Graph

A knowledge graph was constructed using the `networkx` library to visualize the complex relationships between patients, their diagnoses, and outcomes. This provides an intuitive way to explore patient data and verify connections within the dataset.

## üîÆ Future Work

The model shows promising results, but there are several avenues for future improvement:

* **Advanced Architectures:** Explore more complex neural network architectures like Transformers or attention-based models.
* **Feature Engineering:** Create new, more informative features from the existing data to improve predictive accuracy.
